# Introduction
This is an accounting application, which can help users solve many problems in daily life accounting. When the user has income or 
expenditure, he only needs to record it in this application, and the application can help you count the user's weekly bill, monthly 
bill, and annual bill. And let users know how much money each card spends or saves. You can visualize the percentage of the user's 
spending or income on different things through the chart. By the way, you can also set up repayment reminders to help you remember the
repayment date of each card.

#Getting started
